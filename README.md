DarkWord 🎯🧩✨

DarkWord is a reverse crossword puzzle game built to run as a Devvit application on Reddit. Instead of filling in letters, you start with a grid full of letters and must “black out” the extra ones to uncover the hidden words related to a daily theme. It’s a crossword with a twist—no clues on where the words start or end, just cryptic hints and your puzzle-solving wits!
How to Play 🎮🕹️

    Start a New Game: Select "Create New DarkWord Game" from your subreddit’s menu. A new interactive post (your puzzle) will appear.
    Analyze the Grid: Every cell is filled with a letter. Some form valid words (related to the daily theme) and others are distractions.
    Check the Clues: Use the cryptic clues to figure out which letters belong to the hidden words. The words form a crossword pattern, but their locations are not given outright.
    Black Out Cells: Click on cells to “black them out.” You want to remove all the distracting letters so that only the correct words remain.
    Peek Feature 🔍: Feeling stuck? Use the Peek button (up to 3 times per game) to highlight cells that should be eliminated—giving you a nudge in the right direction!
    Completion 🎉: Once you’ve correctly isolated all the words, the game ends. Your completion time is recorded and displayed on a leaderboard for everyone in the community to see.
